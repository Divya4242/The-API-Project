## About APIs

1. Purchasing Power Parity(PPP) - This helps you to convert your salary using PPP, instead of the exchange rate, helps to give you a better approximation of what your standard of living would be like in two different countries. This can be handy to know if you're planning on moving, a remote worker, sending money abroad, or many other things.

2. Foreign Exchange Rate(ForEx) - With this API, you can convert one currency to another and see its fluctuation rate over a specified period of time.

3. Weather API - It helps you to get weather details of any city.
